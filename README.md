# CMPM 121 D1 Project

This has been a basic incremental game made for CMPM 121 using TypeScript, HTML, and CSS. You click the bee to collect honeycombs. You spend honeycombs to buy upgrades that increase automatic production. Each upgrade raises your honey output rate. Prices rise after each purchase to keep progress balanced. The project followed an incremental development process. It started with a single clickable button and counter. Later steps added automatic growth, upgrades, and price scaling. The final version replaced hard-coded logic with a data-driven design. Five upgrade types give you more options for building your hive. The visuals use warm gold colors, soft glow effects, and animated honey drips. The result is a clean, functional game loop that shows how small steps build a complete interactive experience.
